# Brainstorming Ideas:

### 1. Food Pantry Tracker
- User can store all their foods and see when they will expire or are not safe to eat. The user can set if the item is in the fridge or freezer and when they bought it


### 2. Job Skills App
- Looks at recent job postings to determine what skills are currently in the highest demand


### 3. World Trends App
- Gives a feed of social media trends and news from a chosen foreign country, translated to English, ex. Korean media news

### 4. Daily Song App
- User can choose a song every day and share it with all their friends, like Instagram memos


# Top 2
### 1. Food Pantry Tracker
- **Mobile:** This app is one users will need to check consistently as food is constantly being consumed and goes bad within weeks or days. Having push notifications when an item is about to expire is a useful feature that a website cannot provide. Potentially you may want a feature to take a picture of a food item instead of entering the item manually.
- **Story:** The value of the app is immediately obvious since most people in America have had the experience of having to throw out food since they didn't keep it properly. Furthermore, there is an angle of sustainability in reducing food waste.
- **Market:** The existing apps with this functionality are outdated and poorly-received. However, the app is useful for everyone. It does not have a niche market; instead it could be potentially adopted by every person in the country.
- **Habit:** The app concept is not addicting since it is more for record-keeping than gaining new information. However the user could end up using it multiple times per week if not every day from the nature of checking food.
- **Scope:** The basic version of this app is relatively simple, only requiring basic conditional logic and storing tableviews. Therefore it is reasonable to build with a basic understanding of Swift.

### 2. World Trends App
- **Mobile:** This app has potential to incorporate Map and Push features as you can receive updates about news in other countries.
- **Story:** Many people want to be informed about the everyday trends and culture of another country, especially those who are learning a language, in a diaspora, or preparing to live abroad.
- **Market:** The market for this app is a little niche, catering to those who are specifically interested in foreign culture and travel.
- **Habit:** The app has the potential to be frequently used to keep up-to-date on trends and memes from another country. Since news updates every day, there is an incentive to routinely check the app to stay current.
- **Scope:** The basic version of this app would require making API calls to various services, which may be difficult to configure. It may also be difficult to support many different countries, but a single country is reasonable.
